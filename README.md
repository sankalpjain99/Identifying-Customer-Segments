# Identifying-Customer-Segments

Part of Udacity's Introduction to Machine Learning with PyTorch Nanodegree. Proprietary data from Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution was used in this project. Unsupervised Learning techniques like KMeans are used to organize the general population into clusters, then those clusters are used to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, good amount of data cleaning has also been performed on the dataset.

## Requirements
 - NumPy
 - pandas
 - Sklearn / scikit-learn
 - Matplotlib (for data visualization)
 - Seaborn (for data visualization)
